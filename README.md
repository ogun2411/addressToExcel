Georgia Tech ECE-3600 Final Project

# Background
For our project, we chose to analyze Black-owned businesses because these establishments often face unique challenges threatening their sustainability, particularly within the critical first 18 months of operation. Statistics show that eight out of ten Black-owned businesses fail within the first 18 months. Just as important, research shows that only about 40% of Black-owned businesses receive approval for loans, which can significantly hinder their ability to manage expenses and remain financially viable. By integrating the Google Solar API, which provides valuable data on solar energy potential based on location coordinates, we aim to explore how solar panel adoption can help these businesses reduce energy costs. Lowering overhead expenses through renewable energy solutions offers a tangible way to enhance their financial stability and contribute to their long-term success.
